# Ashwanth-NodeMCU-Firmware
This is a Lua-based interactive firmware for ESP8266, ESP8285, and ESP32 modules, developed by Ashwanth. Built on the NodeMCU open-source firmware, it uses an SPIFFS file system for easy control of ESP Wi-Fi SOCs. This project supports all ESP modules, making it a powerful tool for IoT applications.
